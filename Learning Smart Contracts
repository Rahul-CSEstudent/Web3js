web3.eth.Contract :
          The web3. eth. Contract object makes it easy to interact with smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain. When you create a new contract object 
you give it the json interface of the respective smart contract and web3 will auto convert all calls into low level ABI calls over RPC for you.

var abi = <abi of a contract from ether scan>
var address = <address>
var ContactAddress = <address of the Contract>

var contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, ContractAddress)
>> contract
>> contract.methods

>> contract.methods.name().call()
>> contract.methods.name().call((err, result) => { console.log(result) })
